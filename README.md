## **Project Description**

In this project I learned how to build an admin dashboard using CSS Grid.
CSS Grid is a grid-based layout system in CSS that helps you to simplify the process of laying out a webpage or web application.

The full implementation of the project can be found [here].(https://wilsonsiaw.github.io/admin-dashboard/)
