## **Project Description**

In this project I learned how to build an admin dashboard using CSS Grid.
CSS Grid is a grid-based layout system in CSS that helps you to simplify the process of laying out a webpage or web application.

The full implementation of the project can be found [here](https://wilsonsiaw.github.io/admin-dashboard/).

## **Features**

The main idea behind this project was to learn how to lay out a page using nothing
but CSS Grid.

There were three major sections in the dashboard that needed to be laid out. These sections were:

**The header**:

**The sidebar**:

**Main Content Cards**:

**Side Content Cards**

The key to laying out the different sections and elements within the sections was learning how to nest grids or create grids within grids.
